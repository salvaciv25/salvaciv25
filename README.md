# Ciao, I'm Salvatore Civiello! 👋

I am an **Mathematical Engineering Student** specializing in **Modelling for Science and Engineering**. My work focuses on the intersection of structural mechanics, fluid dynamics (CFD), and High-Performance Computing (HPC), surrogate models and Deep Learning.

## Featured Engineering Projects

### Fluid Dynamics & CFD
* **[CFD-Project: Vortex Shedding Past Bluff Bodies](https://github.com/salvaciv25/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-Project)** *Comparative study using **Kratos Multiphysics** on Circular, Square, and Hexagonal cylinders at $Re=100$. Analyzing wake dynamics and Strouhal numbers.*
* **[Numerical Methods for Continuous Systems](https://github.com/salvaciv25/Numerical-Methods-for-Continuous-System)** *Implementation of FEM solvers in **MATLAB** for Advection-Diffusion (SUD stabilization) and Stokes equations (GLS & Bubble schemes).*

### Structural Mechanics
* **[Non-Linear Truss Analysis](https://github.com/salvaciv25/Non-Linear-Truss-Analysis)** *Developed a **Total Lagrangian** FEM solver in MATLAB for large deformations. Applied to bike frame stress analysis and **auxetic materials** (Negative Poisson's Ratio).*

### High-Performance Computing (HPC)
* **[High-Performance Linear Solvers](https://github.com/salvaciv25/High-Performance-Computing-Project)** *Optimized C++ implementation of iterative solvers (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Gradient Method) using **OpenMP** for parallel execution.*

### Deep Learning
* **[Symbolic Music Generation with VAEs](https://github.com/r15i/DeepLearnigMidi)** (Collaborative Project)
    * **Architecture:** Developed and compared **Convolutional VAEs** and **Residual VAEs (ResNet-inspired)** for piano-roll generation.
    * **Data Engineering:** Processed the **MAESTRO dataset** into segmented symbolic representations (128 pitches x 16 time steps).
    * **Optimization:** Investigated the impact of learning rates and residual blocks on reconstruction fidelity and latent space regularization.
    * **Evaluation:** Performed quantitative analysis using Pitch Distribution Similarity, Rhythm Similarity, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
### 🛰️ Space Engineering & Leadership
* **Thermal Control Team Leader | AlbaCubeSat (UniPD)** (Jan 2025 - Present)
    * **Leadership:** Leading the thermal control design for a 1U CubeSat model.
    * **Testing & Validation:** Participated in the **ESA Academy Thermal Vacuum Test (TVAC)** campaign in Belgium (2025). Validated thermal models using experimental data in collaboration with Radian Systems.
    * **Documentation:** Authored verification plans, test procedures, and post-test reports for space qualification.
    * **Publication:** Co-author of a technical paper presented at the **International Astronautical Congress (IAC 2025, Sydney)**.
